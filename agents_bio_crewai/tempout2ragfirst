If any SQL access is required, you have access to a table that was created
with this SQL command:
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reactions (
            REACTION_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            EC TEXT
    ```
Create a description of the sub-queries to handle this user-query:
    Find a list of any reactions that have the same EC number as product Histidinol-phosphatase in genome feature fig|83332.12.peg.3503 ?
Prepare the correct sub-queries (there may just be one) and pass them
along to the query_executor.  You should only use the SQL query capability
if the data is obviously in the SQL tables provided.

[32;1m[1;3mTo answer the user-query, we need to perform two steps:

1. Identify the EC number associated with the product "Histidinol-phosphatase" in the genome feature "fig|83332.12.peg.3503". This information is likely contained within the text files about genomes and features of genomes.
2. Once we have the EC number, we need to find all reactions that have the same EC number. This information will be in the SQL database, as the EC number is a field in the reactions table.

Given that we need to know the EC number before we can query the SQL database, the sub-query to the text files must be performed first.

Here are the sub-queries in the correct order:

1. Sub-query to the genome text files:
   - Description: Extract the EC number for the product "Histidinol-phosphatase" associated with the genome feature "fig|83332.12.peg.3503".

2. Sub-query to the SQL database:
   - Description: Retrieve a list of reactions that have the same EC number as the one obtained from the first sub-query.
   - SQL Query: `SELECT REACTION_ID FROM reactions WHERE EC = ?;` (The question mark `?` will be replaced with the actual EC number obtained from the first sub-query.)

The first sub-query must be executed before the second one because the result of the first sub-query (the EC number) is required as input for the second sub-query.

```
Final Answer: The correct order of sub-queries to answer the user-query is as follows:

1. Perform a sub-query to the genome text files to extract the EC number for the product "Histidinol-phosphatase" associated with the genome feature "fig|83332.12.peg.3503".
2. Use the EC number obtained from the first sub-query to perform a sub-query to the SQL database with the query `SELECT REACTION_ID FROM reactions WHERE EC = ?;` to find a list of reactions with the same EC number.

You will receive a set of one or two sub-queries from the query_planner.
Use those tools to perform SQL queries and/or RAG (text) queries as necessary.
Your final answer MUST be a correct answer to the original user-query:
    Find a list of any reactions that have the same EC number as product Histidinol-phosphatase in genome feature fig|83332.12.peg.3503 ?
