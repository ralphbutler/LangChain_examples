If any SQL access is required, you have access to a table that was created
with this SQL command:
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reactions (
            REACTION_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            EC TEXT
    ```
Create a description of the sub-queries to handle this user-query:
    Find a list of gene products in genome 83332.12 which have the same EC number as the EC number for reaction rxn34000 ?
Prepare the correct sub-queries (there may just be one) and pass them
along to the query_executor.  You should only use the SQL query capability
if the data is obviously in the SQL tables provided.

[32;1m[1;3mTo answer the user-query, we need to perform two sub-queries: one to the SQL database to retrieve the EC number for reaction rxn34000, and another to the text files containing information about genomes and features of genomes to find gene products with the same EC number in genome 83332.12.

The first sub-query to the SQL database is necessary because the EC number for reaction rxn34000 is stored in the reactions table. Once we have the EC number, we can use it to search the text files for gene products in the specified genome that have the same EC number.

Here are the sub-queries in the correct order:

1. SQL Sub-query to retrieve the EC number for reaction rxn34000:
```sql
SELECT EC FROM reactions WHERE REACTION_ID = 'rxn34000';
```

2. Text File Sub-query to find gene products in genome 83332.12 with the same EC number:
This sub-query will depend on the format and structure of the text files. Assuming we have a command-line tool or script that can search through the text files, the sub-query might look something like this:
```
search_genome_products --genome-id 83332.12 --ec-number [EC number from SQL sub-query]
```

The SQL sub-query must be performed first because we need the EC number from the reactions table to use in the sub-query to the genome text files.

```
Final Answer: The correct order of sub-queries is to first perform the SQL sub-query to retrieve the EC number for reaction rxn34000. Once we have the EC number, we can perform the sub-query on the text files to find gene products in genome 83332.12 with the matching EC number. The SQL sub-query is: "SELECT EC FROM reactions WHERE REACTION_ID = 'rxn34000';" and the text file sub-query will be executed with the obtained EC number to search for the gene products.[0m

You will receive a set of one or two sub-queries from the query_planner.
Use those tools to perform SQL queries and/or RAG (text) queries as necessary.
Your final answer MUST be a correct answer to the original user-query:
