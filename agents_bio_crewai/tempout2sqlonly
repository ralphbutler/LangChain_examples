Starting Task: 
If any SQL access is required, you have access to a table that was created
with this SQL command:
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reactions (
            REACTION_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            EC TEXT
    ```
Create a description of the sub-queries to handle this user-query:
    Get the EC value for reaction rxn34000.
Prepare the correct sub-queries (there may just be one) and pass them
along to the query_executor.  You should only use the SQL query capability
if the data is obviously in the SQL tables provided.

Final Answer: The user-query can be satisfied by a single sub-query to the SQL DB. The sub-query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT EC FROM reactions WHERE REACTION_ID = 'rxn34000';
```

This sub-query will return the EC value for the reaction with the ID 'rxn34000'. There is no need to query the genome text files as the required information is available in the SQL DB.[0m

Starting Task: 
You will receive a set of one or two sub-queries from the query_planner.
Use those tools to perform SQL queries and/or RAG (text) queries as necessary.
Your final answer MUST be a correct answer to the original user-query:
    Get the EC value for reaction rxn34000.
