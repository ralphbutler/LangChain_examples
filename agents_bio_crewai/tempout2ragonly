Working Agent: Query Planner
Starting Task: 
If any SQL access is required, you have access to a table that was created
with this SQL command:
    ```sql
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reactions (
            REACTION_ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            EC TEXT
    ```
Create a description of the sub-queries to handle this user-query:
    What is the name of the genome with identifier 83332.12 ?
Prepare the correct sub-queries (there may just be one) and pass them
along to the query_executor.  You should only use the SQL query capability
if the data is obviously in the SQL tables provided.

Final Answer: The user-query does not require any SQL sub-query as the information about the genome identifier is not present in the SQL table provided. The SQL table only contains information about reactions and their EC numbers. 

The user-query can be satisfied by a single sub-query to the genome text files. The sub-query would be to search the genome text files for the genome with the identifier 83332.12 and return its name.[0m

Starting Task: 
You will receive a set of one or two sub-queries from the query_planner.
Use those tools to perform SQL queries and/or RAG (text) queries as necessary.
Your final answer MUST be a correct answer to the original user-query:
    What is the name of the genome with identifier 83332.12 ?
